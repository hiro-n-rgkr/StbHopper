## Karamba3d Integration

If you want to use the Karamba3D integration feature, move Karamba.gha to a folder where you do not have administrative privileges; Karamba3D folders are usually located in Program flies > Rhino > Plug-ins.

:::note
If you do not need the linkage, you can avoid component loading errors by deleting the karambaConnect.gha file in the HoaryFox folder.
